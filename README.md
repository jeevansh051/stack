# stack
A basic cpp code while describing stack

## Theory:
- A stack is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, called the top.
- A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last is the first element to come out.
- The insertion of an element into the stack is called push operation, and the deletion of an element from the stack is called pop operation.
- In stack, we always keep track of the last element present in the list with a pointer called top.

### Applications of stack:

- 1.Some CPUs have their entire assembly language based on the concept of performing operations on registers that are stored in a stack.
- 2.Stack structure is used in the C++ run-time system.

### Explaination of the functions:
- 1.The function Push() in the class Stack is used to add an element in the stack.
- 2.The function Pop() in the class Stacks is used to remove an Element from the stack.
- 3.The function Pop() in the class Stacks is used to print/see the topmost element of the stack.
- 4.The function Print() in the class Stacxk is used to print all the elements in the stack.

### Algorithm
- 1.Start
- 2.Create a Class called Stacks
- 3.Create the basic functions (Add elements, remove elements etc). Keep in mind all the possible scenerios. (This stack is made by arrays,so scenerios like stack full,stack empty etc)
- 4.Try all the possible functions.(Adding, removing, Displaying etc)
- 5.End

### Outcomes:
- The basic implementation of Stacks.
